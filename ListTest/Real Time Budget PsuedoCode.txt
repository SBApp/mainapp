Real Time Budget 
----------------
Goal: Checks every 10 seconds if the budget date has been reached.

Process:
Create timer that calls a function and has a 10 second delay, repeating
The function called creates a new Date variable, and checks that with the ending budget date variable.
If times up the function calls appropriate function to clear bar, move list to reports, and reset current list

When page changes, reset timer. (Make sure it runs function when it resets)
